# README for code and data of Rapid structural network changes in bird communities

## Introduction

This repository provides R script and data used to assess network changes in French common bird communities between 2001 and 2017, reported in Rigal, S., Devictor, V., & Dakos, V. (2025). Rapid structural network changes in bird communities. bioRxiv, 2025-02 (https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.02.14.638220).

## Prerequisites

The R scripts have been implemented on R version 4.2.2. All the required R packages with their version are listed in "packages.R".

## Contents 

### Folder structure

`output`: provides intermediate datasets constructed along the analysis  
`raw_data`: contains the initial datasets used to run the whole analysis. `dataprp` comes from the French Breeding Bird Survey (STOC-EPS https://www.vigienature.fr/fr/suivi-temporel-des-oiseaux-communs-stoc), `SXI_publi` from Godet et al. (2014) Dissociating several forms of commonness in birds sheds new light on biotic homogenization (https://doi.org/10.1111/geb.12266) and  `life_history_bird2` from Storchová and Hořák (2018) Life-history characteristics of European birds (https://doi.org/10.1111/geb.12709). See the manuscript for additional details.  
`function_XXX.R`: scripts of functions for the analysis  
`packages.R`: R packages required  
`main_code.Rmd`: R script with explanations

### File formats 

Raw data are provided both in `csv` (and zipped csv) and `rds`. Output data are in `rds` and can be used in R.

## Usage

Please refer to the`main_code.Rmd` file for usage details.
